# IOC Lookup
This simple chrome extension works on taking highlighted selected text and appending it to predetermined URL's (these can be changed in the content.js file). 
This extension can identify non public IP adresses, domains (regex based on https:// or http://), SHA256 hashes and windows event codes (based onan exact 4 numeric digits.)
